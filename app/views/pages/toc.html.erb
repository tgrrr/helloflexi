    <h1>Hello Flexi Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><b>Version 1.0</b></p>

    <ol class="list-terms">
      <li>HelloFlexi is operated by Horeli Pty Ltd (“<b>the Company</b>”) and consists of the App and Website (collectively the “<b>Product</b>”).  These Terms of Use may be updated by the Company from time to time without notice to you (“<b>the Terms</b>”).</li>
      <li>All Members, and any other person who accesses, browses or uses the Product, accepts and agrees to be bound by these Terms, any posted guidelines, frequently asked questions (“<b>FAQs</b>”), privacy policy or other rules of the Company, including as modified from time to time at the Company’s sole discretion. From time to time, HelloFlexi may change or amend these terms. If we do, we may notify you, either through the user interface, in an email message, or through other reasonable means. If you use the Services after the Date the changes become effective you consent to the changed terms. If you don’t agree, you must stop using the Services, cancel any paid Services by following the instructions on the Site and close your HelloFlexi membership. Otherwise, the new terms will apply to you.</li>
      <li>Members may attend a total of 30 classes during each membership cycle (“<b>Eligible Classes</b>”) across studios available on the HelloFlexi platform (“<b>Studio</b>”), but may not make more than four visits to any particular Studio during each membership cycle (“<b>the Limitation</b>”). Members cannot transfer their Eligible Classes entitlements to any other person. HelloFlexi does not guarantee availability to any classes provided by the Studios, and access to classes is on a space-available basis.</li>
      <li>A Member’s HelloFlexi membership starts on the date that the Member subscribes with the Company (“<b>Start Date</b>”). Each HelloFlexi membership cycle is one month in length, and a <b>Renewal Date</b> occurs every one month after the Start Date.  The membership automatically renews each month and a new <b>Membership Cycle</b> begins unless the membership has been cancelled prior to the Renewal Date.  A Member becomes entitled to attend the Eligible Classes when each new Membership Cycle begins.  Any Eligible Classes that are not used during a Membership Cycle are forfeited (i.e. not available during the next Membership Cycle).</li>
      <li>The <b>Monthly Membership Fee</b> is payable for each Membership Cycle, including in full for a Membership Cycle in which a Membership is cancelled or terminated.  The Company is not required to notify Members of any change to the Monthly Membership Fee.</li>
      <li>Members must provide the Company with an acceptable method of payment (“<b>Payment Method</b>”).  The Company will bill a Member for the first Membership Cycle on the day on which Member first subscribes to HelloFlexi.  The Monthly Membership Fee will then be billed on the same day ("<b>Billing Day</b>") each month.  Where a Member’s Billing Day is not contained in a particular month (e.g. 31st), the Company will bill the member of the last business day of the month.  The Company reserves the right to change the timing of billing (and for example, will do so where a Member’s Payment Method does not successfully settle).  Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for Membership Cycles as a result of partial use or termination or cancellation of the Membership.  Upon cancellation, a Member will continue to be entitled to access HelloFlexi until the end of the Member’s current Membership Cycle.  At any time and at its discretion, the Company may provide a refund, discount or other consideration to some or all Members (“<b>Credits</b>”), and the provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle a Member to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate the Company to provide Credits in the future.  If a Member’s Payment Method fails to process successfully in relation to a Monthly Membership Fee, the Member remains responsible for any amounts owed to the Company and authorises the Company to continue billing the Payment Method, including after it is updated by the Member.</li>
      <li>Some Studios may charge additional equipment, amenity or other fees.  HelloFlexi only provides access to the class for which a Member has booked or signed up to. All cancellations must be made at least 12 hours before class time. Late cancellations will incur a $5 late cancellation fee. Members may cancel a booking through the Classes page by clicking on the Cancellation button on the class that was previously booked or via email to info@helloflexi.com.</li>
      <li>The Company may, in its sole discretion and at any time, without incurring any liability to a Member or other third party and without providing prior notice, terminate any Membership, delete any content uploaded by Members to the Product, discontinue providing access to the Product or any part of the Product.  Members must not infringe copyright on the Product and any copyright infringements by a Member will be the sole responsibility of the Member.</li>
      <li>By using the Product, each Member represents and warrants that they are an individual of at least 18 years of ago who has not previously had their membership terminated.  Each Member must ensure that the information it provides to the Company (e.g. Payment Method and email address) remains true and current at all times.  Each Member will create a password upon becoming a Member and is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and for all activity that occur under the Member's account.</li>
      <li>In using the Product, each Member undertakes not to harass, threaten or defraud other Members or Product users; make unsolicited offers, advertisements, proposals, or send junk mail to other Members or Product users; access another Member’s account; provide a HelloFlexi password to any other person; permit any third party (including other members) to use any classes booked under that Member’s membership; misrepresent the source, identity or content of information transmitted via the Product, including infringing copyright or other proprietary rights; upload material (e.g. viruses) that damage computer systems or the data of the Company, Members users of the Product; or send any content that the Company considers to be inappropriate (e.g. content that is pornographic, threatening, offensive, defamatory or libellous).</li>

Member Submissions are not controlled, approved or authorised by the Company.  The Company does not guarantee the anonymity or confidentiality of any Member Submissions.  All Member Submissions are the sole responsibility of the person who makes each Member Submission.  The Company makes no representations that it will publish or make available on the Product any Member Submissions and may edit or remove any Member Submission at any time.  By making a Member Submission, the Member grants the Company and its shareholders, sublicensees and assignees (collectively, “<b>the Company’s Licensees</b>”) a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit the Member Submission and in connection with the Product and the Company’s (and its successors’) business (including using the Member Submission and derivatives thereof for marketing and promoting).

Each member represents and warrants in connection with each Member Submission that they own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents and permissions to use and authorise the Company to use all patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to the Member Submission, and to grant the rights and license set out above.  Each member warrants that the Member Submissions, the Company’s or any of the Company’s Licensee’s use of such Member Submissions pursuant to these Terms, and the Company’s or any of the Company’s Licensee’s exercise of the license rights set forth above, do not and will not (A) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (B) cause injury to any other person; (C) violate these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; or (D) require obtaining a license from or paying fees or royalties to any third party for the exercise of any rights granted in these Terms, including, by way of example and not limitation, the payment of any royalties to any copyright owners, including any royalties to any agency, collection society, or other entity that administers such rights on behalf of others.

      <li>A provision of these Terms may be waived only in writing, signed by both the Company and the Member.  The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms will not affect such party’s right at a later time to enforce any provision of these Terms.

      <li>If a dispute arises between the Company and a Member or user, the Company’s goal is to provide a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.  Any claim or dispute that arises in relation to this Agreement or the Product (a “Claim”) will be resolved in accordance with this clause or as the Company and the Member or user otherwise agree in writing.  The Member must first contact the Company to seek a resolution and the Company will consider all reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures as alternatives to litigation.  These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria.  Each Member and user agrees that any Claim may only be brought in a Victorian court, except as otherwise agreed by the parties.  For any Claim where the amount sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration.  Where a party elects arbitration, they must initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“<b>ADR</b>”) provider that is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (A) the arbitration must be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner of the arbitration will be chosen by the initiating party; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties (or any witnesses) unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
      <li>If any provision of these Terms is unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision is severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company relating to the subject matter of the Terms, and may only be modified in writing (signed by the Company and the Member) or by a change to these Terms made by the Company.  Any cause of action arising out of or related to these terms or the Product must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrues, and may not be commenced (and is forfeited) if not commenced within one year after the cause of action accrues.</li>
